  <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12" id="p" ><p id="a">Chicken</p><p id="x">we're going to have a float based layout. Also gave each and one of them a boarder but, that's just so we could see it on the screen. And then what I'm doing is pretty simple and something that I've described before. And what I'm doing is I'm just saying okay so, if it's a 12 column layout that means each column is 100 % divided by 12 so, that becomes a 0.33%. Well the two columns is 100 divided by 12 times two, and that's 16.66% and so on and so on until we get to column large 12 and that's going to take up 100% of the entire grid and neither these are the styles we have defined for large screen devices. Now what about medium screen devices? What we're going to do, is we're going to have a range and I picked the lower part of the range to be 950 pixels which is not exactly the standard, bootstrap has a different number that it uses, but I just pick this for a demo purposes because I'm going to needed to demonstrate something for you and you’ll see that in a minute. And again I'm listing all this classes and again it going to be left, floating left, and again I'm giving him a boarder. And this time I'm doing the same thing except, I'm now calling this md for medium.</p></div>
